General Guidelines 
● This leave policy is designed to ensure equitable and responsible use of leaves, while fostering effective communication and operational efficiency. Please adhere to these guidelines and feel free to contact the HR department for any clarifications or specific scenarios not covered in this policy. 
● As organizational needs and legal requirements evolve, this policy may undergo periodic reviews and adjustments.

Casual Leaves 
● Casual leave is not eligible for carryover. Any remaining unused casual leave at the end of the calendar year will not be transferred to the following year. We encourage our employees to use their casual leave entitlement within the current year. 
Sick Leaves 
● Sick leave can be carried over to the next calendar year, but this carryover is limited to a maximum of 5 days. Any unused sick leave days exceeding this limit will be forfeited.

Reporting Unplanned Absences 
● In situations of unplanned absences due to illness or emergencies, employees are required to inform their absence by posting a message in the WhatsApp group before the designated check-in time of 11 AM. This allows us to manage workloads effectively and make necessary arrangements. 
Leave Application Process 
● For both Casual and Sick leave, employees must notify their intention by posting in the WhatsApp group before the designated check-in time of 11 AM. In cases of late notification, the requested leave will not be considered, and a deduction of one day's salary will be applied. However, exceptions may be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 
Misuse or Abuse of Leave 
● Any form of misuse or abuse of leave will result in disciplinary actions, up to and including termination of employment. This policy is in place to maintain the integrity of our leave system and ensure fair treatment for all employees. 
Leaves Bridge Policy 
● Effective from 18th July 2024, a Bridge Day refers to a day or multiple days taken off between a national holiday and a weekend. 
● Employees taking Bridge Days will adhere to the following guidelines: 
Leave Deduction: The number of Bridge Days taken will be deducted from the employee's available casual or sick leave balance, depending on the type of leave used. Salary Deduction: If an employee takes a Bridge Day without sufficient casual or sick leave remaining, the equivalent salary deduction will apply for each day taken. 
For example, if a national holiday falls on a Thursday and an employee takes leave on the following Friday, this would constitute a Bridge Day. Four leaves will be deducted in this case. 
Total Leaves 
● Casual 10 
● Sick 10
